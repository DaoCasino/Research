# What is Research? 

Research is a design document providing information to our community, or describing a new feature for Dao.casino or its processes or environment. The Research should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

# In which cases Research is being needed

Improving takes a few months of work for one or several team developers. It is being typed in roadmap and also publicly tracked of implementation process. For example, we are producing a game, which needs serious level redesign - in this case research is being needed.
