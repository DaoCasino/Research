## Решение
Cardboard is being used by those, who operates with their smartphones. And there are a lot of gambling games in it. On the other hand, Playstation store has none. The most popular VR-helm Samsung Gear also works with smartphones, with a market leader Google.So the most obvious solution for development is to use WebVR, which is a JavaScript framework.

* absolutely open source
* friendly for WEB developers
